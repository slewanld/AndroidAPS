/**
 * Calculator interface for Time In Range (TIR) statistics.
 *
 * This interface provides methods for calculating standard Time In Range statistics,
 * which measure the percentage of time blood glucose values fall within, below, or
 * above user-defined target ranges.
 *
 * Unlike Dexcom TIR which uses fixed 5-range categorization, standard TIR uses
 * user-configurable low and high thresholds to create 3 ranges:
 * - Below range: < lowMgdl
 * - In range: lowMgdl to highMgdl
 * - Above range: > highMgdl
 *
 * The calculator supports:
 * - Per-day TIR calculations stored in a LongSparseArray keyed by midnight timestamp
 * - Averaging across multiple days
 * - User-configurable range thresholds
 * - Typical time periods: 7 days or 30 days
 *
 * Common threshold values:
 * - Low: 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L)
 * - High: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
 *
 * Error handling: Glucose values < 39 mg/dL are counted as errors and excluded.
 *

 * @see app.aaps.implementation.stats.TirCalculatorImpl
