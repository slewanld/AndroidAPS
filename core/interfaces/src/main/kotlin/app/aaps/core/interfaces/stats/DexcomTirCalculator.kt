/**
 * Calculator interface for generating Dexcom-style Time In Range (TIR) statistics.
 *
 * This interface is responsible for calculating comprehensive glucose range statistics
 * following Dexcom's methodology over a 14-day period. It analyzes blood glucose readings
 * from the database and categorizes them into 5 ranges (Very Low, Low, In Range, High, Very High).
 *
 * The calculator:
 * - Retrieves glucose readings for the last 14 days
 * - Applies time-of-day aware range thresholds (different for day vs night)
 * - Calculates percentage distributions across all ranges
 * - Computes statistical measures (mean, standard deviation)
 * - Estimates HbA1c from mean glucose values
 *
 * Implementation is typically marked as @Reusable for dependency injection optimization.
 *
 * @see DexcomTIR
 * @see app.aaps.implementation.stats.DexcomTirCalculatorImpl
