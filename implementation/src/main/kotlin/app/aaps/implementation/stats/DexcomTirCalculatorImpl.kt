/**
 * Implementation of Dexcom Time In Range (TIR) statistics calculator.
 *
 * This class calculates comprehensive glucose statistics following Dexcom's methodology
 * over a fixed 14-day period. It retrieves blood glucose readings from the persistence layer
 * and processes them into a [DexcomTIR] object containing all statistical measures.
 *
 * The calculation process:
 * 1. Determines the time range (midnight 14 days ago to current midnight)
 * 2. Retrieves all BG readings from the database within this range
 * 3. Processes each reading into appropriate glucose ranges
 * 4. Returns a DexcomTirImpl with all calculated statistics
 *
 * This class is marked as @Reusable for efficient dependency injection, as it has no
 * mutable state and can be shared across multiple injection points.
 *
 * @property dateUtil Utility for date/time calculations
 * @property persistenceLayer Database layer for retrieving BG readings
 *
 * @see DexcomTirCalculator
 * @see DexcomTirImpl
